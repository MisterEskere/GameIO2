# GameIO

GameIO is a crossplatform desktop game client to download and install videogames.
It uses Rawg.IO api keys (even tho its planned to changed to another API key) to retrive info about games (name, genras, pictures...). 
It uses its own Rust web scraper to find the games on 1337x.
It uses librqbit library to manage torrents.

This project is heavly inspired by [Hydra Launcher](https://github.com/hydralauncher/hydra)

## This is a work in progress project and a v0 is still not available.
If you want to help with the development feel to contact me.
